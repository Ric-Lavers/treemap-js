# Treemap

It maps trees (not really).

TODO:

- Improve layout
  - Pick direction based on width/height again
- Make sure text is readable
  - Hide text when it's wider than the rect
    - And then show it on hover or click
- Highlight rect on text hover
- Multiple datasets, animate between them
- Language filtering / highlighting
- Max depth ?
